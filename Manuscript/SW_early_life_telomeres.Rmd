**Running head:** Telomeres and silver spoons

###Abstract
Understanding the short and long term costs of individual early-life experiences is fundamental to understanding life-history evolution. Telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of chromosomes, shorten in response to oxidative stress, and telomere shortening is correlated with reduced survival. Thus, telomere dynamics may help us quantify individual variation in early-life costs, and enhance our understanding of how poor conditions in early life are related to later-life survival. We tested how telomere dynamics are related to spatiotemporal variation in early-life conditions and later-life survival in the Seychelles warbler (*Acrocephalus sechellensis*), across multiple cohorts spanning 14 years. we found that, in accordance with other studies, telomere length and loss are greatest in early life. However, we also show that juvenile telomere lengths varies markedly among cohorts. We found no evidence that early-life social environment (number of helpers, group size) or ecological conditions (territory quality) were related to telomere length, although we found tentative evidence that telomere length varied among summer and winter breeding season. Finally, we found that increased survival later in life was associated with longer telomeres and reduced telomere shortening rates in early life, but these effects could . Our results highlight the inmportance of cohort effects in studies of telomere length, and suggest that

###Introduction
Exposure to favourable environmental conditions during development and growth can confer fitness advantages later in life [so called 'silver spoon effects'; @Grafen1988; @Monaghan2008]. Adult fitness can be affected by a range of early-life experiences, including the quality of the habitat and available resources [@Madsen2000; @VandePol2006; @Hayward2013], population density [@Nussey2007;@Douhard2013] and natural or anthropogenic environmental disturbance [@Reid2003; @Cartwright2014]. Understanding the causes and consequences of these early-life experiences is key to understanding many ecological and evolutionary  processes, including  patterns of natural and sexual selection,  population growth rates and even local extinction [@Coulson2001; @Roach2014]. Understanding silver spoon effects is therefore of central interest to ecologists, evolutionary biologists and conservationists.

While it is clear that silver spoon effects can occur, we have little understanding of how and under what conditions early-life environments will affect adult fitness. However , we do expect the later-life consequences of a good or poor start to vary among individuals, populations and species because the phenotypic consequences of an adverse environment can depend on an individual's initial condition, and genetic or epigenetic makeup [@Hoffman2000; @Richards2006]. Moreover, it is not always possible to fully quantify what constitutes a good or bad environment, and any 'hidden' environmental variation may obscure relationships between the early-life conditions that are measured and the resulting adult phenotypes. Indeed, the pervasiveness of silver spoon effects varies between species [@Drummond2011], cohorts [@Reid2003] and sexes [@Wilkin2009]. We therefore need to understand, or at least be able to measure, how the environment affects individuals differentially within a population in order to elucidate the later-life consequences of early-life experience.

Telomeres - the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes - may provide a solution to this problem. Telomeres shorten with age [@Monaghan2006], and in response to oxidative stress, which can be elevated  due to environmental factors [@VonZglinicki2002]. When telomeres become critically short cells senesce [@Campisi2003], and the accumulation of these cells can result in organismal senescence and death  [@Wong2003]. This association between senescence and telomere length has inspired a great deal of recent research into telomere evolutionary ecology [reviewed in @Horn2010; @Haussmann2010; @Monaghan2014]. While there is little direct evidence that the relationship between telomere dynamics and survival is causal [@Barrett2011; @Simons2015], there is now excellent evidence that telomeres can act as biomarkers of cost in wild populations, providing a signature of the ecological stress that has been experienced and is otherwise difficult to detect [@Monaghan2014; @Schultner2014; @Asghar2015].

There is evidence from a range of taxa that the greatest rate of telomere loss occurs in early life [e.g. @Frenck1998; @Haussmann2003], and that the extent of this telomere shortening is influenced by the conditions experienced during that period [@Price2013; @Monaghan2014; @Nettle2015; @Reichert2015]. Importantly, early-life telomere dynamics have been associated with both short-term and late-life survival [@Heidinger2012; @Boonekamp2014], and with other parameters such as cognition [@Nettle2015a]. However, few studies have simultaneously analysed how telomere dynamics, early-life conditions and late-life survival are all related in a natural setting. Moreover, how early-life telomere dynamics vary over spatial and temporal scales is poorly understood.

The longitudinal study (since 1986) of the Seychelles warbler (*Acrocephalus sechellensis*) population on Cousin Island provides an excellent system for studying senescence in the wild [reviewed in @Hammers2015]. Due to the isolated nature of the study population and intensive field monitoring, we have unusually comprehensive survival data and tissue samples spanning many years (see Methods, below). Ecological conditions and warbler population density on Cousin vary across space and time due to weather-induced changes in foliage cover and food availability [@VandeCrommenacker2011a]. Seychelles warblers remain on their natal territories for at least six months, and variation in the oxidative stress experienced by individuals is associated with natal  territory quality [@VandeCrommenacker2011a]. However, neither early-life nor adult survival appear to be associated with natal territory quality or natal local density [@Brouwer2006; @Hammers2013]. Facultative cooperative breeding occurs in the Seychelles warbler [@Komdeur1994a; @Richardson2003a], and the presence of helping subordinates (but not non-helping subordinates) in the natal territory is associated with increased survival later in life [@Brouwer2012]. Lastly, we have an established protocol for assessing absolute telomere length in this species [@Barrett2012], and telomere length predicts survival independently of age in adult Seychelles warblers, suggesting that telomeres act as a biomarker of cost [@Barrett2013a]. Thus, we have an excellent system in which to assess the costs of different social and environmental conditions experienced early in life, and to assess the later-life consequences of early-life conditions.

In this study we examine how telomeres link early-life environmental variation to late-life fitness in the Seychelles warbler. Because telomere dynamics are expected to reflect individual-level variation in the costs of early-life experiences, they may allow a more sensitive analysis of the effects of early-life environmental variation than would be possible with a direct comparison of how survival is affected by the early-life environment. With this in mind, we first conduct an exploratory analysis of how the environmental and social factors experienced in early life affect telomere dynamics. We then test the hypothesis that longer telomeres and lower rates of telomere shortening in early life are associated with greater survival.


###Methods

#####Study species and sampling
The Seychelles warbler is a small (~15 g), insectivorous passerine bird with a mean life expectancy of 5.5 years at fledging [@Hammers2013]. The population of *ca*. 320 birds on Cousin Island (04'20'S, 55'40'E) has been intensively studied since 1986 [@Richardson2003b; @Spurgin2014a]. This species has two breeding seasons, running from June-August (main breeding season) and December-February (minor breeding season), when the breeding females on each of the *ca*. 115 territories lay one or, rarely, two or three eggs [@Komdeur1991]. As a result of this low reproductive output, combined with higher mortality in first-year birds [39%; @Brouwer2006], cohort sizes in the Seychelles warbler are small (<50).

Individuals are usually ringed in their first year of life, and so are of known age. They are then followed throughout their lives, and as they are non-migratory endemics naturally confined to the island [@Komdeur2004a], a biannual census of birds on Cousin during each breeding season gives accurate measures of local density, social status (e.g. breeding male/female, helping subordinate, non-helping subordinate) and individual survival [@VandeCrommenacker2011; @Barrett2013a]. The isolated nature of the Cousin population is a key advantage of the system for analyses involving survival, which in other systems are often confounded by emigration [see @Ergon2014 for a recent discussion]. Full details of catching and monitoring methods can be found in Brouwer *et al.* [-@Brouwer2012].

Seychelles warblers are highly territorial and all territories are mapped during the breeding seasons using detailed observational data of foraging and territorial defence behaviour, and surveyed for territory quality [@Richardson2003b]. Territory quality is calculated based on territory size, foliage cover and insect abundance [@Komdeur1992], and territory quality estimates obtained across years are averaged to obtain a single value for each territory [@Hammers2013]. Cousin is subject to intra- and inter-annual variation in rainfall and food availability, and such island-wide temporal variation may override the effects of individual territory quality. As an estimate of seasonal variation in food availability, we calculated an index of the number of insects across the entire island during each breeding season. This  index represents the average number of insects found per unit leaf area over all surveys carried out on the island in a breeding season.

Each time a bird is caught on Cousin body mass and tarsus length are measured (to the nearest 0.1g and 0.1mm, respectively), and age is confirmed on the basis of eye colour [@Komdeur1991a] and previous captures [@Richardson2003b]. A blood sample (*ca* 25 $\mu$l) is taken from each bird captured via brachial venipuncture, and stored at room temperature in 1 ml of absolute ethanol in a 1.5 ml screw-cap microfuge tube.


#####Molecular methods
For each sample, genomic DNA was extracted from a ~2 mm^2^ flake of preserved blood using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen), following the manufacturer's protocol, with the modification of overnight lysis at 37^o^C and a final DNA elution volume of 80 $\mu$l. DNA concentration and purity were quantified using a NanoDrop 8000 Spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific), and DNA integrity was validated by visualization with ethidium bromide after electrophoresis on a 1.2% agarose gel. Sex was determined using the molecular method outlined by Griffiths *et al.* [-@Griffiths1998].

Telomere lengths were measured in `r nrow(juv)+nrow(Loss)` samples, . Of these, `r nrow(juv)` were taken cross-sectionally from birds caught within their first year of life, between `r min(as.numeric(paste(juv$LayYear)))` and `r max(as.numeric(paste(juv$LayYear)))`. For a subset of first-year birds (n = `r nrow(Loss)` individuals) we had longitudinal data, with an additional sample taken within two years of the original catch. 

We measured absolute telomere quantity per diploid genome for all samples using a quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay [@Barrett2012]. Post-qPCR processing of samples was carried out as in Barrett *et al.* [-@Barrett2012], with the following amendments. First, averaging of technical repeats was carried out using custom made R scripts (available as supplementary material). Second, a change in batch of SYBR green forced us to raise the annealing temperature of the telomere reaction from 58^oC to 61^oC. This resulted in consistently higher, but repeatable, CQ values for the telomere reaction, so we implemented a simple correction to ensure that telomere lengths were repeatable across annealing temperatures (supplementary material). Finally, we excluded telomere lengths greater than 30kb, which maximised repeatability of our own data [see also @Bauch2012]. Inter-plate repeatability of final telomere lengths was assessed using the R package rptR [@Schielzeth2011].

For the subset of samples with longitudinal data we calculated a rate of telomere loss between the first-year and adult samples by subtracting adult telomere length from early-life telomere length and dividing this difference by the length of time (in days) between sampling events. To account for regression to the mean effects, we applied a correction based on correlations among samples within individuals following Verhulst *et al.* [-@Verhulst2013].


#####Statistical analyses
We performed all analyses using R version 3.0.1 [@RDevelopmentCoreTeam2011]. We used  general linear mixed models along with model averaging to explore how spatial variation in early-life environmental and social conditions influenced telomere length within cohorts. As explanatory variables we included age class (nestling or fledgling), tarsus length, sex, territory quality, season (summer or winter) and the number of helping and non-helping subordinate birds present in the natal territory. As random effects we included birth year and qPCR plate ID. We first created a full model containing all of the above terms, and a top model set was then defined, containing all models with AICc $\leq$ 6 compared to the best supported model [@Burnham2011]. We report model-averaged coefficients, confidence intervals and 'relative importance', which reflects the relative weights of each predictor variable across the top model set. For individuals with longitudinal data (*n* = `r nrow(Loss)`) we repeated the above analyses of telomere dynamics, replacing telomere length with telomere loss as the response variable. In the analysis of telomere loss we also included initial telomere length as an explanatory variable, as longer telomeres have been shown to decrease in length more rapidly, even after correcting for regression to the mean [@Verhulst2013]. Model averaging was carried out using the MuMIn package (version 1.10.5) in R [@Barton2012].

We used Cox regression to test whether survival was related to individual-level telomere length and rate of loss. We ran these models with and without lay year as a frailty term to test whether any effects on telomere length on survival could be explained by cohort effects.

###Results

#####Early-life telomere length and age
Inter-plate repeatability of telomere length, based on `r length(table(dd0[duplicated(dd0$BloodID),]$BirdID))` samples measured at least twice, was 0.78 (CI = 0.73-0.82). Mean ($\pm$ standard error) telomere length in first-year birds was longer than in adults of any age (Fig. 1A). We also found substantial age-related variation in telomere length within the first year of life, with longer telomeres in nestlings compared to fledglings (ANOVA; F = `r round2(anova(lm(TLKB~Fledged,data = juv))[1,4])`; P = `r round3(anova(lm(TLKB~Fledged,data = juv))[1,5])`; Fig. 1B).

#####Cohort-level variation in early-life telomere dynamics
Early-life telomere length varied significantly among breeding seasons (one-way ANOVA, F = `r round2(anova(lm(TLKB~factor(FieldPeriodID),data = juv))[1,4])`; P = `r round3(anova(lm(TLKB~factor(FieldPeriodID),data = juv))[1,5])`), with a tendency toward shorter telomeres in more recent years (linear regression of mean telomere length and lay year, R^2^ = `r round2(summary(lm(TLKBmean~LayYear,data=juvseason,na.action=na.exclude))$r.squared)`; F = `r round2(anova(lm(TLKBmean~LayYear,data = juvseason,na.action=na.exclude))[1,4])`; P = `r round3(anova(lm(TLKBmean~LayYear,data = juvseason,na.action=na.exclude))[1,5])`; Fig. 2). Variation in mean telomere length over breeding seasons was not related yearly variation in island-wide food availability (linear regression, R^2^ = `r round2(summary(lm(TLKBmean~Insect,data=juvseason,na.action=na.exclude))$r.squared)`; F = `r round2(anova(lm(TLKBmean~Insect,data = juvseason,na.action=na.exclude))[1,4])`; P = `r round2(anova(lm(TLKBmean~Insect,data = juvseason,na.action=na.exclude))[1,5])`).

#####Individual-level variation in early-life telomere dynamics
The top model explaining within-season variation in early-life telomere length contained age class, tarsus length and season (summer vs winter) (Table S1). This model was much better supported than the null model ($\Delta$AICc = `r round2(AICc(lmer(LogTL~1+(1|FieldPeriodID)+(1|PlateID),data=juv,REML = FALSE))-AICc(lmer(LogTL~Fledged+Tarsus+Season+(1|FieldPeriodID)+(1|PlateID),data=juv,REML = FALSE)))`). All three variables importance in the top model set, but only ageclass had confidence intervals that did not overlap zero (Fig. 3A). Telomere length was slightly longer in juveniles born in winter compared to summmer seasons, and this effect appeared most pronounced in nestlings (although sample size of nestlings born in winter seasons is very small) (Fig. 4A). Tarsus length was negatively related to telomere length, although much of this effect could be explained by ageclass, as fledglings have both longer tarsi and shorter telomeres compared to nestlings  (Fig. 4B).

The longitudinal data showed the same patterns as the cross-sectional data. The top model explaining telomere loss again contained age class, tarsus length and season, although in this instance the top model was only a marginally better fit than the null model ($\Delta$AICc = `r round3(AICc(lmer(TROC~(1|LayYear),data=Loss,REML = FALSE))-AICc(lmer(TROC~Fledged+Tarsus+Season+(1|LayYear),data=Loss, REML = FALSE)),lessthan=F)`). Fledglings lost telomeres at a lower rate compared to nestlings, while birds with longer tarsi and birds born in winter seasons had higher rates of telomere shortening compared to those born in the summer (Fig. 3B). However, it is important to note that sample size for this longitudinal analysis was small and all confidence intervals overlapped zero (Fig. 3B).

#####Early-life telomere dynamics and survival

A survival model including only early-life telomere length revealed a significant and positive effect on survival (estimate = `r round3(summary(coxph(with(juv,Surv(Lifespan+1,Died)~LogTL)))$coefficients[1])`, P = `r round3(summary(coxph(with(juv,Surv(Lifespan+1,Died)~LogTL)))$coefficients[5])`; Fig. 2). However, when we controlled for cohort effects by including lay year as a frailty term in the model, telomere length was no longer a significant predictor of survival (estimate = `r round3(summary(coxph(with(juv,Surv(Lifespan+1,Died)~LogTL+frailty(LayYear))))$coefficients[1,1])`, P = `r round3(summary(coxph(with(juv,Surv(Lifespan+1,Died)~LogTL+frailty(LayYear))))$coefficients[1,6])`). The longitudinal data showed that the amount of telomere shortening experienced in early life had no effect on survival, regardless of whether we included lay year (estimate `r round3(summary(coxph(with(Loss,Surv(Lifespan+1,Died)~TROC+frailty(LayYear))))$coefficients[1,1])`, P = `r round3(summary(coxph(with(Loss,Surv(Lifespan+1,Died)~TROC+frailty(LayYear))))$coefficients[1,6])`), or excluded it (estimate `r round3(summary(coxph(with(Loss,Surv(Lifespan+1,Died)~TROC)))$coefficients[1])`, P = `r round3(summary(coxph(with(Loss,Surv(Lifespan+1,Died)~TROC)))$coefficients[5])`).

###Discussion
Here we show that telomeres are related to both early-life conditions and later-life survival in the Seychelles warbler. We first show that telomere length and rates of shortening in early life are subject to strong cohort effects, and that cohort-level telomere dynamics can be explained by island-wide temporal variation in food availability. We then show that within cohorts, the social environment (i.e. number of helpers) affects telomere length specifically at the nestling stage. Finally, we show that telomere length in early life predicts later-life survival. These findings have important implications for research on life history evolution in wild populations.

The clearest result from our study is that telomere length varies markedly among cohorts. Very few studies have shown that temporal variation in telomere dynamics occurs in natural populations, and the studies that have done so were limited to just two seasons [@Mizutani2013; @Watson2015]. The long-term Seychelles warbler dataset has allowed us, using many more cohorts than has been used in other studies, to show that temporal variation in telomere dynamics does occur at the population level.

We suspect that the novelty in our finding temporal, environmentally-induced variation in telomere dynamics within a population is more due to a lack of available long-term datasets with telomere screening, rather than the Seychelles warbler being unique. Indeed, the environment on Cousin is benign in comparison with many regions outside the tropics, where populations undergo large fluctuations in size [e.g. @Coulson2001]. If our findings are replicated in other systems and population-level variation in early-life telomere dynamics is common in nature, this has a number of ramifications for our understanding of senescence in natural populations. First, our findings suggest that the telomere dynamics of a population at a given point in time represent a snapshot of a temporally varying process. More research is now needed within and across multiple cohorts and populations to better understand the complexity of telomere evolutionary ecology. Second, our findings raise the interesting prospect of using telomeres as indicators of population health - an approach that would be useful to a broad range of conservation and animal health practitioners. However, further research across populations with different environments and genetic histories is required in order to provide further insight into the usefulness of telomeres as biomarkers of population health.

Despite a large sample size and reasonable repeatability, we found little evidence that any of the social or environmental vairables we measured affect juvenile telomere length in the Seychelles warbler. This is surprising a poor social and ecological environment is known to be detrimental to juvenile Seychelles warblers, both in terms of oxidative stress and later life survival. Future research should therefore examine, in a quantitative genetic framework, how genetic and environmental components, and their interactions, affect telomere dynamics and senescence in natural populations [@Becker2015; @Asghar2014].

We found tentative evidence that, in addition to age class, tarsus length and season had an effect on juvenile telomere length (Figs 3, 4). The tarsus effect most likely reflects the fact that in passerine birds tarsus length is correlated with age during the nestling stage [@Ricklefs1976]. Telomere loss is most rapid early in life due to ongoing cell replication [@Frenck1998], and a negative correlation between telomere length and body size in early life is therefore expected. Indeed, that age class affects both tarsus length and telomere lengths can be clearly seen in our data (Fig. 4B). The difference in telomere length between birds born in summer and winter seasons is more surprising, especially given the directionality of the effect. We find that birds born in winter seasons having longer telomeres (Fig. 4A), while the opp. One possible explanation for this is that parents in good condition are more likely to breed  

While the relationship between mortality and telomeres in adults has been established for some time [@Cawthon2003], only recently has the link between later-life survival and early-life telomere dynamics been studied. In captive zebra finches, juvenile telomere length predicts late-life survival [@Heidinger2012], and in wild bird populations survival to the nestling phase [@Watson2015], and survival to adulthood [@Boonekamp2014], have been linked with early-life telomere dynamics. 

Finally, our study highlights some of the diffculties asosciated with studying telomere dynamics in natural populations.

Our longitudinal dataset was limited, both in terms of sample size and resolution (i.e. time between sampling events). Seychelles warblers are rarely sampled more than once within their first year of life, so much of the telomere shortening that occurs in early life will be missed with our sampling regime. It is likely, therefore that only very strong effects of environmental variation on telomere loss will  be detected in this dataset. Thus telomere length constitutes a better indicator of early-life stress.

There are numerous avenues for future research into telomere evolutionary ecology in this system and others. Here we have considered survival, but telomere length and shortening in early life may also be linked to other components of fitness [reviewed in @Monaghan2014]. Reproductive senescence occurs in the Seychelles warbler [reviewed in @Hammers2015], making this system well suited to examining how telomere length predicts lifetime reproductive success.  We expect that by gaining a fuller understanding of telomere dynamics in natural populations, the fields of life-history evolution and evolutionary ecology will be greatly enhanced.
